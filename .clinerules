# Environment Setup
1. Activate Python virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   & C:\dev\venvs\multi-llm-wrapper\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

2. Verify/Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

# Session Initialization Steps
1. Read latest continuation prompt at:
   docs/brave-dev/continuation-prompts/2025-[most-recent-timestamp].md

2. Query knowledge graph for current architecture:
   Use server-memory MCP tool to search 3 separate consecutive 1-word queries for:
   - "VirtualEnvironment" (development environment)
   - "ProjectStructure" (project architecture)
   - "QueryAnalyzer" (component status)

3. Review documentation:
   - README.md
   - docs/multi-llm-synthesis.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/README.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/architecture.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/implementation.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/configuration.md

4. Git Status:
   ```powershell
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   ```

# Knowledge Graph Search Pattern
- Always use the following patten when searching the knowledge graph:
      1. More-specific search query
      2. Concot and perform *at least* 5 additional seperate/distinct 1-word search queries you can do that are comprised of:
         1. Some of the same terms, but as individual words
         2. Different terms that are other variations in spelling or construction of the individual terms
         3. Synonms and related words that may yield results.
      3. 1 final more-specific search query
      4. Do not abort this sequence early just because you obtained results.
         1. Assume that there are more results that were documented with alternate keywords, and also did not have relationships properly created in the knowledgegraph to other entities.
         2. Therefore if you abort this thorough search sequence prematurely, you will not have the full understanding you need, and will probably make assumptions & mistakes.

# Additional Context
- Following KISS principle
- Test-driven development
- Azure deployment target
- Company-only access requirements
- Using PowerShell for Windows environment
- Virtual environment required for development
- Github username is exactdoug
