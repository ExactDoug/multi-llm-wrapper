# Environment Setup
1. Activate Python virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   & C:\dev\venvs\multi-llm-wrapper\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

2. Verify/Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Start test server (if needed):
   ```powershell
   python -m brave_search_aggregator.test_server
   ```

4. Verify test server:
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8001/health
   curl http://localhost:8001/config
   ```

5. Start production server (if needed):
   ```powershell
   python -m multi_llm_wrapper.web.run
   ```

6. Verify production server:
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

# Session Initialization Steps
1. Read latest continuation prompt at:
   docs/brave-dev/continuation-prompts/2025-[most-recent-timestamp].md

2. Query knowledge graph for current architecture:
   Use server-memory MCP tool to search for the following separate distinct terms:
   - "BraveSearchClient" (API integration status)
   - "KnowledgeAggregatorImplementation" (processing status)
   - "TestServer" (infrastructure status)
   - "RateLimiter" (rate limiting status)
   - "WebIntegration" (web service status)
   - "StreamingVerification" (streaming status)
   - "ErrorHandling" (error handling patterns)
   - "BraveKnowledgeAggregatorModelPattern" (model interface implementation)
   - "AsyncIteratorPattern" (async iteration implementation)

## CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH SEARCH METHODOLOGY
  DO NOT COMBINE SEARCH TERMS WHEN QUERYING THE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH!
  THE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH CAN HANDLE MULTI-WORD SEARCH STRINGS, BUT DO NOT COMBINE
  MULTIPLE SEARCHES INTO 1 SEARCH. IT WILL INTERPRET THIS AS 1 LITERAL SEARCH
  TERM, AND WILL YIELD NO RESULTS. THEREFORE THE ABOVE QUERIES MUST BE DONE
  AS SEQUENTIAL/CONSECUTIVE INDVIDIDUAL QUERIES TO THE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH FOR EACH
  OF THE INDIVIDUAL TERMS / SEARCH STRINGS.

3. Review documentation:
   - README.md
   - docs/multi-llm-synthesis.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/README.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/architecture.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/implementation.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/configuration.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/testing-strategy.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/parallel-testing-infrastructure.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/scope-updates/2025-01-23-streaming-first.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/phases/phase1-streaming.md
   - docs/brave-dev/knowledge-aggregator/phases/phase2-content.md

4. Git Status:
   ```powershell
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   ```

# Development Focus
[Copy relevant section from continuation prompt's "Next Development Session Tasks"]

# Testing Infrastructure
1. Always use test server (port 8001) for development
2. Monitor rate limiting and API usage
3. Check logs for errors and warnings
4. Verify feature flag behavior
5. Document test scenarios and results
6. Run streaming verification tests
7. Test error handling scenarios
8. Verify web integration
9. Verify async iterator implementation:
   - Test proper __aiter__ and __anext__ implementation
   - Verify coroutine handling in async chain
   - Check streaming response format
   - Test error propagation through iterator chain

# Production Verification
1. Environment Setup
   - Verify BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY in .env
   - Check rate limit configuration
   - Verify logging setup

2. Integration Testing
   - Test streaming behavior
   - Verify error handling
   - Check synthesis integration
   - Monitor API usage

3. Performance Monitoring
   - Track response times
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check resource usage
   - Verify concurrent load

# Small-Scale, Low-Budget, MVP, KISS Methodology
1. Prioritize getting to the first MVP
2. Keep code simple
3. Keep plans simple
4. Don't change project plans and/or scope without the user's express consent
5. Notify the user if any suggested changes may add to the complexity or duration of the project

## Business Reality
We are a small business with very limited resources. We must focus on accomplishing the currently-defined
objectives, or we will never make it to the next stage of the project. We need to keep it simple until
we tell you otherwise.

# Prioritize Security
In all our efforts for simplicity and focusing on the current scope and objectives, if at any point
you become aware of security-specific concerns, you must make this a priority and present these
to the user, even if it may impact the timing of the project stage completion.

# Real-World Tests
Real-world tests are important, even if only in our local dev PC with local servers we can configure
here to replicate the production environment. It is important we do not consider any aspect of the
project as complete until it has undergone some type of practical real-world test where the code
is executing in a scenario extremely similar to the production environment.

# Additional Context
- Following KISS principle (Keep It Simple Roo)
- Test-driven development
- Azure deployment target
- Company-only access requirements
- Using PowerShell for Windows environment
- Virtual environment required for development
- Github username is exactdoug
