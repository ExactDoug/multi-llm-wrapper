# Revised Plan for Adding Copy Buttons

This document outlines the revised plan for adding copy buttons next to LLM names and the master synthesis title in the multi-llm-wrapper project.

## Steps

1. **Identify HTML Elements:** Use browser developer tools or inspect the HTML source code of `index.html` to identify the elements displaying the LLM names and the master synthesis title.

2. **Add Button Elements:** For each identified element:
    - Wrap the element and a new button within a parent `div` with `position: relative`.
    - Style the button using CSS with `position: absolute` to align it to the left of the text element. Ensure the button is visually appealing and doesn't disrupt the existing layout.

3. **Implement Copy Functionality:**
    - Use the Clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`) in JavaScript to copy the text content of the parent `div` when the button is clicked.
    - Add an event listener to each copy button to trigger this functionality.

4. **Provide Visual Feedback:**
    - Implement a non-intrusive visual feedback mechanism, such as a temporary icon change or a subtle toast notification, to inform the user that the text has been copied successfully.
    - Ensure consistent styling by incorporating necessary CSS rules within `styles.css`.

## Considerations

- **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid):** Prioritize simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity in the implementation.
- **Code Style:** Maintain consistent code style and adhere to project conventions.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the functionality after implementation to ensure it works as expected across different browsers.
