# Project State Overview - 2025-02-20 03:30 AM

## Current Status
The Brave Search Knowledge Aggregator project is in active development, with focus on the content enrichment component. Recent work has centered on resolving configuration mismatches and improving error handling in the content enrichment pipeline.

## Key Components Status

### Content Enrichment Pipeline
- **Status**: In Development
- **Progress**: 75%
- **Critical Issues**: Error recovery rate exceeds threshold (75% vs required 40%)
- **Next Steps**: Input sanitization and score calculation refinement

### Quality Scoring
- **Status**: Implemented, Needs Refinement
- **Progress**: 90%
- **Issues**: Type conversion errors in score calculations
- **Next Steps**: Enhance error handling for non-numeric inputs

### Source Validation
- **Status**: Implemented, Needs Enhancement
- **Progress**: 85%
- **Issues**: Score thresholds not met for intermediate/shallow content
- **Next Steps**: Adjust scoring weights and validation logic

## Critical Metrics

### Performance
- First Status: ✓ < 100ms
- First Result: ✓ < 1s
- Source Selection: ✓ < 3s
- Memory Usage: ✓ < 10MB per request
- Error Rate: ✗ Currently at 75% (target < 1%)

### Resource Usage
- API Rate Limit: ✓ Within 20 requests/second
- Connection Timeout: ✓ Set to 30 seconds
- Max Results: ✓ Limited to 20 per query

## Immediate Priorities
1. Fix error recovery mechanism to reduce error rate
2. Implement robust type checking in score calculations
3. Adjust scoring weights to meet quality thresholds
4. Enhance input validation across all components

## Risk Assessment
- **High**: Error recovery rate significantly above threshold
- **Medium**: Score calculation reliability
- **Low**: Memory management and performance metrics

## Next Development Session
Focus will be on implementing input sanitization and refining score calculations to address the error rate and scoring threshold issues.
