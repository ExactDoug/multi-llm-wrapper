# Project State Overview - 2025-02-20 03:36 AM

## Project Evolution

### Historical Approaches
1. **Initial Architecture (Phase 0)**
   - Batch Processing Based
   - Status: Deprecated
   - Reason: Performance limitations
   - Replaced By: Streaming-first architecture

2. **Streaming Implementation (Phase 1)**
   - Basic streaming support
   - Status: Enhanced
   - Evolution: Now fully streaming-first
   - Note: Core architecture preserved

3. **Error Handling (Original)**
   - Basic error recovery
   - Status: Replaced
   - Issue: Insufficient for requirements
   - Current: Enhanced with fallbacks

## Current Status
The Brave Search Knowledge Aggregator project is in active development, with focus on the content enrichment component. Recent work has centered on resolving configuration mismatches and improving error handling in the content enrichment pipeline.

## Key Components Status

### Content Enrichment Pipeline
- **Previous Status**: Early development
- **Current Status**: In Development
- **Progress**: 75%
- **Critical Issues**: Error recovery rate exceeds threshold (75% vs required 40%)
- **Next Steps**: Input sanitization and score calculation refinement
- **Historical Note**: Evolved from batch processing to streaming

### Quality Scoring
- **Previous Status**: Basic implementation
- **Current Status**: Implemented, Needs Refinement
- **Progress**: 90%
- **Issues**: Type conversion errors in score calculations
- **Next Steps**: Enhance error handling for non-numeric inputs
- **Historical Note**: Originally part of knowledge aggregator

### Source Validation
- **Previous Status**: Initial implementation
- **Current Status**: Implemented, Needs Enhancement
- **Progress**: 85%
- **Issues**: Score thresholds not met for intermediate/shallow content
- **Next Steps**: Adjust scoring weights and validation logic
- **Historical Note**: Split from main validation logic
