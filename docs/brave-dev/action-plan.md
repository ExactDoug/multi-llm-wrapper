## Status Tracking and Change Management
To maintain context and focus, we will:
1. Keep the action plan as a static document that is only updated when tasks are completed
2. Use a separate "Progress Log" section for ongoing updates and comments
3. Avoid modifying the original plan structure once work has begun
4. Reference this document in commit messages and PRs for context

## Progress Log
- [Date] - [Initial Creation]
- [Date] - [Update 1]
- [Date] - [Update 2]

## File Permissions
To prevent accidental modifications, the action plan document should be set to read-only after finalization. This ensures that the plan remains a stable reference throughout the project lifecycle.
