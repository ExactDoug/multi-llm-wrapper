    min_depth_score: float = 0.7
    source_weights: Dict[str, float]  # Validated weights
    quality_metrics: Dict[str, float]  # Validated metrics
    
    # Performance monitoring
    enable_performance_tracking: bool = True
    track_enrichment_timing: bool = True
    track_memory_usage: bool = True
    track_error_rates: bool = True
