# Brave Search Integration Master Plan

## Introduction
This document outlines the staged implementation plan for integrating Brave Search API into the multi-llm-wrapper project. The plan follows a minimum viable product (MVP) approach with clear testing periods between development stages.

## Project Goals
1. Enhance LLM responses with real-time web search capabilities
2. Maintain cost efficiency using Brave Search API paid tier
3. Ensure stable, reliable integration with proper error handling
4. Allow for future extensibility without overcomplicating initial implementation

## Implementation Strategy
- Start with MVP core functionality
- Each stage includes:
  1. Development period with clear scope
  2. Testing period (no new development)
  3. Bug fixing phase
  4. Documentation updates
  5. Planning refinements for next stage

## Cost Management
- Using Brave Search API paid tier:
  - $3 CPM (cost per thousand queries)
  - Up to 20 queries per second
  - Up to 20 million queries per month
- Each stage includes cost monitoring and optimization

## Timeline Overview
1. Stage 1: MVP Core Integration (4 weeks)
2. Stage 2: Enhanced Results & Reliability (4 weeks)
3. Stage 3: Performance Optimization (4 weeks)
4. Stage 4: Advanced Features (4 weeks)

## Success Metrics
1. Reliable search result integration
2. Response enhancement quality
3. Cost efficiency
4. System stability
5. Query performance
