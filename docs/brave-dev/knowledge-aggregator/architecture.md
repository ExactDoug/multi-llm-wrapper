# Brave Search Knowledge Aggregator - Architecture

## Overview
The Brave Search Knowledge Aggregator enhances search capabilities by processing and synthesizing web search results. This document reflects both currently implemented features and planned enhancements, with a focus on stabilizing existing functionality before expanding further.

## Component Relationships

### Search Engine Knowledge Source Pattern
The Brave Search Knowledge Aggregator implements a pattern for search engine-based knowledge sources that can be reused for future implementations:

1. QueryAnalyzer
   - Specialized for search engine-based knowledge sources only
   - NOT used for regular LLM interactions
   - Provides query optimization and validation
   - Can be reused by future search engine knowledge sources

2. Knowledge Processing Pipeline
   ```
   User Query -> QueryAnalyzer -> Search API -> KnowledgeAggregator -> Grid Display
   ```

This pattern separates search engine knowledge sources from regular LLM interactions, allowing specialized query processing while maintaining clean integration with the multi-llm-wrapper system.

## Current Implementation Status

### Currently Implemented
- Basic query processing and validation
- Brave Search API integration
- Simple parallel processing
- Initial MoE routing framework
- Basic grid integration
- Feature flag system

### Pending Real-World Testing
- Parallel processing efficiency

- Grid display integration
- Error handling robustness
- Feature flag behavior

### Planned for Post-MVP
- Enhanced task vector operations
- Advanced SLERP-based merging
- Sophisticated monitoring
- Advanced metrics tracking

## System Components

- Reusable for future search engine integrations

### 2. Content Fetcher
Location: `src/brave_search_aggregator/fetcher/`
- Manages Brave Search API interactions
- Handles content retrieval from web pages
- Implements rate limiting and error handling

### 3. Knowledge Processing Components
Location: `src/brave_search_aggregator/synthesizer/`

#### Knowledge Synthesizer
Currently Implemented:
- Basic response combination
- Initial MoE-style routing framework
- Simple result formatting
- Reference tracking

Planned Post-MVP:
- Advanced task vector operations
- SLERP-based merging
- Multiple synthesis modes

#### Knowledge Aggregator
Currently Implemented:
- Basic parallel processing

- Detailed source metrics

### 4. Utility Components
Location: `src/brave_search_aggregator/utils/`
- Common functionality
- Configuration management
- Error handling
- Feature flags

## Data Flow

1. Input Processing:
```
User Query -> Query Analyzer -> Search String
```

2. Search & Content Retrieval:
```
Search String -> Brave Search API -> Top Results -> Content Fetcher -> Processed Content
```

3. Result Combination:
```
[Search Results] -> Knowledge Synthesizer -> Final Response
```
