# Backend-Only Appending Plan Review & Verification

**Document Purpose:**  
This review analyzes the backend-only approach for appending a standard string to user queries before LLM submission, as described in [`append-standard-string-architecture.md`](../append-standard-string-architecture.md). Focus areas: MVP suitability, security, idempotency, edge cases, and compliance with incremental methodology.

---

## 1. Where and How to Append (Backend)

- **Location:**  
  The standard string should be appended in the backend route handler that receives the user query, specifically in [`src/multi_llm_wrapper/web/service.py`](../../src/multi_llm_wrapper/web/service.py).
- **Implementation:**  
  After extracting the query from the request, append the standard string _before_ dispatching to any LLMs.  
  Example:
  ```python
  query = data['query']
  if not query.endswith(STANDARD_STRING):
      query = query.rstrip() + " " + STANDARD_STRING
  ```
  - Place this logic immediately after parsing the incoming request data.
  - Use a constant for the standard string to ensure maintainability.

---

## 2. Idempotency (No Double-Append)

- **Requirement:**  
  The standard string must not be appended more than once, even if the request is re-processed or if both frontend and backend attempt to append.
- **Best Practice:**  
  - Check if the query already ends with the standard string (using `.endswith()` after stripping whitespace).
  - Only append if not already present.
- **Reference:**  
  - [Perplexity spot-check, July 2025]:  
    > "Idempotent string appending in Python web APIs is best achieved by checking for the presence of the string using `.endswith()` or a regex, and only appending if absent. This prevents double-appending in both normal and edge cases (e.g., trailing whitespace)."

---

## 3. Security and Robustness

- **Enforcement:**  
  - Appending in the backend ensures all clients (including direct API users) receive the standard string, making the enforcement robust and not bypassable.
- **Pitfalls & Mitigations:**  
  - **Pitfall:** If the check is too naive (e.g., doesn't handle whitespace or case), attackers could bypass enforcement.
  - **Mitigation:**  
    - Normalize whitespace before checking/appending.
    - Use a strict, exact match for the standard string.
    - Consider logging or rejecting queries that appear to have a malformed or tampered standard string.
- **Reference:**  
  - [Perplexity spot-check, July 2025]:  
    > "Backend-only enforcement is the most robust pattern for mandatory query modifications. Ensure normalization and strict checks to prevent bypass via whitespace or encoding tricks. Avoid relying on frontend enforcement for security."

---

## 4. Edge Cases

- **Empty Queries:**  
  - If the incoming query is empty or only whitespace, decide whether to:
    - Reject the request (recommended for MVP).
    - Or, return a specific error message.
- **Whitespace Handling:**  
  - Always strip trailing whitespace before appending.
  - Ensure the final query is well-formed (no double spaces).
- **Malformed Input:**  
  - Validate input type (should be a string).
  - Consider maximum length checks to prevent abuse.

## 5. Compliance with MVP/Incremental Methodology

- **Findings:**  
  - The backend-only plan is fully compliant with [`dev-methodology-mvp-incremental.md`](../../dev-methodology-mvp-incremental.md) and the compliance review ([`plan-methodology-compliance.md`](plan-methodology-compliance.md)).
  - The approach is simple, atomic, and delivers user-facing value early.
  - Manual testing and change control are emphasized.
  - No unnecessary complexity or deviation from plan.

---

## 6. Spot-Check Results (2025)

- **Idempotency:**  
  - Use `.endswith()` or regex for robust, idempotent appending.
  - Normalize whitespace before checking.
- **Security:**  
  - Backend enforcement is best practice for mandatory query modifications.
  - Avoid relying on frontend for security.
  - Normalize and strictly check for the standard string to prevent bypass.
- **Architectural Pitfalls:**  
  - Avoid appending in multiple places unless double-append is strictly prevented.
  - Document the logic clearly for future maintainers.

---

## 7. Recommendations

- **Adopt backend-only appending** for MVP and enforcement.
- **Implement idempotency** using `.endswith()` after whitespace normalization.
- **Validate input** for type, emptiness, and length.
- **Document** the logic and rationale in code comments.
- **Test** with both frontend and direct API calls to ensure universal enforcement.

---

## 8. Risks

- **If idempotency is not enforced:**  
  Double-appending may occur, especially if frontend logic is later added.
- **If input is not validated:**  
  Malformed or empty queries could cause errors or security issues.
- **If normalization is skipped:**  
  Attackers could bypass enforcement with whitespace or encoding tricks.
