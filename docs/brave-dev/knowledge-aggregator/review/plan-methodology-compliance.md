## Methodology Compliance Checklist

| Principle/Requirement                | Plan & Reviews Compliant? | Notes / Risks / Gaps                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | :-----------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incremental Development**          |           ☑️ Yes           | Tasks are broken into small, focused increments for both frontend and backend.                                |
| **MVP-First / Vertical Slice**       |           ☑️ Yes           | Initial tasks deliver a working, user-facing feature (append string), with vertical slice from UI to backend. |
| **KISS / Simplicity**                |           ☑️ Yes           | Implementation and reviews emphasize minimal, direct changes. No unnecessary complexity observed.             |
| **Manual Testing**                   |           ☑️ Yes           | Each review and plan step includes explicit manual testing instructions and verification steps.               |
| **Change Control**                   |           ☑️ Yes           | Steps are atomic, non-breaking, and require verification before proceeding. Git discipline is referenced.     |
| **Task Structure & Risk**            |           ☑️ Yes           | Each task specifies objective, files, expected outcome, user value, testing, and risk.                        |
| **User-Facing Value Early**          |           ☑️ Yes           | Early tasks deliver visible, testable changes to the user.                                                    |
| **No Unauthorized Deviations**       |           ☑️ Yes           | No evidence of deviation from plan without explicit review/approval.                                          |
| **Documentation & Status Reporting** |           ☑️ Yes           | Reviews and plan document status, testing, and next steps.                                                    |

## Narrative Summary

The append-standard-string plan and all related reviews are in full compliance with the codified development methodology as described in [`dev-methodology-mvp-incremental.md`](../../dev-methodology-mvp-incremental.md). The plan is structured around incremental, atomic tasks that deliver user-facing value early (vertical slice), with each step including clear objectives, risk assessment, and manual testing instructions. Reviews confirm that changes are simple, non-breaking, and tested before proceeding, with explicit change control and status documentation.

**No deviations, risks, or missing elements were identified.** The plan and reviews exemplify the MVP-first, KISS, and change control principles required by the methodology.

---

**Conclusion:**  
✅ The append-standard-string plan and reviews are fully compliant with the codified incremental MVP methodology. No corrective action required.
