### 2.2 Implemented Solutions
1. Async Iterator Pattern:
   ```python
   # RESOLVED:
   def __aiter__(self):
       return self  # Synchronous return

   async def __anext__(self):
       if not self._initialized:
           await self._initialize()
       return await self._get_next()
   ```

2. Memory Management:
   ```python
   # RESOLVED:
   async def cleanup(self):
       async with self._cleanup_lock:
           await self._force_cleanup()
           self._cleanup_required = False
           gc.collect()
   ```
