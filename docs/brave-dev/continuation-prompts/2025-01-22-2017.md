# Development Session Continuation - January 22, 2025 20:17

## Current Status

### Project Context
- multi-llm-wrapper is the main project with integrated components:
  1. Web Interface (Multi-LLM Grid)
     - Basic 5x2 grid layout ✓
     - Simple result display ✓
     - Basic error handling ✓
  2. Core Features (MVP)
     - Basic query processing ✓
     - Simple parallel processing ✓
     - Basic result combination ✓
  3. Advanced Features (Implemented but Need Testing)
     - Initial MoE routing framework
     - Basic task vector operations (placeholder)
     - Simple SLERP-based merging (placeholder)

### Recent Changes
- Added parallel testing infrastructure documentation
- Updated testing strategy for real-world validation
- Established separate test environment (port 8001)
- Documented production service considerations (port 8000)
- Created comprehensive testing procedures

### Current State
1. Production Service
   - Running on port 8000
   - Active staff usage
   - Must remain uninterrupted
   - Stable operation

2. Testing Infrastructure
   - Separate service (port 8001)
   - Isolated configuration
   - Independent monitoring
   - Feature flag controlled

3. Features Ready for Testing
   - Basic query processing
   - Simple parallel processing
   - Grid integration
   - Error handling
   - Feature flag system

## Next Development Session Tasks

### 1. Testing Infrastructure Setup (Immediate Priority)
- Implement test server configuration
- Set up isolated environment
- Configure test-specific logging
- Implement monitoring
- Create launch scripts

### 2. Real-World Testing
- Test with actual Brave Search API
  * Verify query processing
  * Test rate limiting
  * Validate error handling
  * Document actual capabilities

- Test parallel processing
  * Verify with real workloads
  * Monitor resource usage
  * Test error recovery
  * Document performance

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Record test results
- Document performance metrics
- Update implementation guides
- Create troubleshooting documentation

## Testing Focus
- Real-world API interaction
- Parallel processing efficiency
- Grid display functionality
- Error handling scenarios
- Feature flag behavior

## Environment Setup
1. Activate Python virtual environment:
```powershell
& C:\dev\venvs\multi-llm-wrapper\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install/verify dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Key Learnings
1. Production service stability is critical
2. Real-world testing requires careful isolation
3. Documentation must reflect actual setup
4. Feature flags enable controlled testing

## Additional Notes
- Maintain separation between production and testing
- Document all test results thoroughly
- Keep feature flags for controlled testing
- Monitor both environments independently

## Post-Testing Roadmap
Only after real-world testing is complete:
1. Address any discovered issues
2. Optimize based on performance metrics
3. Consider advanced feature activation
4. Plan for production enhancements
