## Documentation Updates: Model Interface Pattern Implementation

### Context
Following the architectural decision to implement BraveKnowledgeAggregator as a model while preserving its enhanced capabilities, this session focused on updating documentation to reflect the pattern.

### Updates Completed
1. Architecture Documentation
   - Added Model Interface Pattern section
   - Documented dual interface approach
   - Updated Successfully Implemented section

2. Component Interactions
   - Added Model Interface Flow diagram
   - Added Model Interface component responsibilities
   - Preserved existing flows and patterns

3. Implementation Guide
   - Documented both internal rich format and model interface format
   - Added format transformation details
   - Updated integration points

4. Knowledge Graph
   - Added BraveKnowledgeAggregatorModelPattern entity
   - Created relationships with existing components
   - Preserved architectural knowledge

### Next Development Session Tasks

1. Code Implementation
   - Implement format transformation in service.py
   - Update BraveKnowledgeAggregator response handling
   - Add error format standardization
   - Verify streaming compatibility

2. Testing Requirements
   - Test format transformation
   - Verify streaming behavior
   - Validate error handling
   - Check synthesis integration
   - Monitor performance impact

3. Integration Verification
   - Test in multi-llm grid
   - Verify all models function
   - Check error propagation
   - Monitor response times

## Notes
- All documentation updates preserve existing knowledge while adding new pattern
- Pattern sets precedent for integrating other non-LLM components as models
- Next session should focus on code implementation
