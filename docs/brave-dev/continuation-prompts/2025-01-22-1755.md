# Development Session Continuation - January 22, 2025 17:55

## Current Status

### Project Context
- multi-llm-wrapper is the main project with integrated components:
  1. Web Interface (Multi-LLM Grid)
     - 5x2 grid layout supporting 10 knowledge sources
     - Streaming responses with real-time updates
     - Response synthesis across all sources
  2. Synthesis Architecture
     - MoE-style routing for model selection
     - Task vector operations for knowledge combination
     - SLERP-based response merging
     - Multiple synthesis modes (research, coding, analysis, creative)
  3. Standalone Components
     - BraveSearchAggregator replacing BraveSearchIntegration
     - Enhanced search and synthesis capabilities
     - Azure deployment target

### Recent Changes
- Implemented provider-specific HTTP response mocking
- Added comprehensive provider response format testing
- Fixed configuration and model map handling
- Improved test suite organization

### Completed Tasks
1. HTTP Mocking Infrastructure
   - Added provider-specific response formats
   - Implemented URL-based response selection
   - Improved error handling at SDK and HTTP levels
   - Added support for both web interface and standalone testing

2. Test Framework Enhancement
   - Added provider-specific format validation
   - Updated provider selection tests
   - Added cross-provider compatibility testing
   - Separated web interface and aggregator component tests

3. Configuration Improvements
   - Fixed TestConfig reference
   - Added proper model map handling
   - Improved provider selection logic
   - Added configuration support for both integration modes

### Current Issues
1. Need to maintain grid functionality during transition
2. Master Synthesizer needs enhancement for new capabilities
3. Integration testing between components needed
4. Source-specific processing needs refinement

## Next Development Session Tasks

1. Synthesis Architecture Enhancement
   - Implement MoE-style routing
   - Add task vector operations
   - Integrate SLERP-based merging
   - Support multiple synthesis modes

2. Knowledge Aggregation Improvement
   - Implement parallel query processing
   - Add source-specific processing
   - Handle conflicting information
   - Preserve source-specific nuances

3. Component Integration
   - Create integration tests
   - Add compatibility layer
   - Document component interactions
   - Implement feature flags

4. Documentation Updates
   - Update synthesis architecture docs
   - Add transition guide
   - Document grid layout changes
   - Add component interaction diagrams

## Required Changes

### Synthesis Architecture Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_synthesis_architecture():
    """Test synthesis architecture components"""
    synthesizer = MasterSynthesizer()
    
    # Test MoE routing
    route = await synthesizer.route_query(
        query="test query",
        synthesis_mode="research"
    )
    assert route.selected_models
    assert route.routing_confidence > 0.8
    
    # Test vector operations
    result = await synthesizer.combine_knowledge(
        responses=[response1, response2],
        operation="task_vector_merge"
    )
    assert result.coherence_score > 0.7
    
    # Test SLERP merging
    merged = await synthesizer.merge_responses(
        responses=[response1, response2],
        interpolation_factor=0.5
    )
    assert merged.consistency_score > 0.8
```

### Knowledge Aggregation Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_parallel_processing():
    """Test parallel knowledge aggregation"""
    aggregator = KnowledgeAggregator()
    
    results = await aggregator.process_parallel(
        query="test query",
        sources=["brave_search", "llm1", "llm2"],
        preserve_nuances=True
    )
    
    assert results.all_sources_processed
    assert results.conflicts_resolved
    assert results.nuances_preserved
```

## Testing Focus
- Synthesis architecture components
- Knowledge aggregation process
- Component integration
- Source-specific processing

## Environment Setup
1. Activate Python virtual environment:
```powershell
& C:\dev\venvs\multi-llm-wrapper\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install/verify dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Key Learnings
1. Synthesis architecture requires careful coordination
2. Source-specific processing crucial for quality
3. Vector operations enhance knowledge combination
4. Test isolation critical for all components

## Additional Notes
- Consider phased synthesis updates
- Monitor vector operation performance
- Plan for backward compatibility
- Consider A/B testing during transition
- Track synthesis quality metrics
