# Development Session Continuation - January 22, 2025 18:16

## Current Status

### Project Context
- multi-llm-wrapper is the main project with integrated components:
  1. Web Interface (Multi-LLM Grid)
     - 5x2 grid layout supporting 10 knowledge sources
     - Streaming responses with real-time updates
     - Response synthesis across all sources
  2. Synthesis Architecture
     - MoE-style routing for model selection
     - Task vector operations for knowledge combination
     - SLERP-based response merging
     - Multiple synthesis modes (research, coding, analysis, creative)
  3. Standalone Components
     - BraveSearchAggregator replacing BraveSearchIntegration
     - Enhanced search and synthesis capabilities
     - Azure deployment target

### Recent Changes
- Implemented initial synthesis architecture with MoE routing framework
- Added task vector operations and SLERP-based merging (placeholder implementations)
- Created knowledge aggregator with parallel processing support

### Current Issues
1. Need to implement actual task vector operations (currently placeholder)
2. Need to implement actual SLERP-based merging (currently placeholder)
3. Need to test parallel processing with real workloads
4. Need to verify feature flag system in production environment

## Next Development Session Tasks

1. Task Vector Implementation
   - Implement actual vector operations
   - Add vector space transformations
   - Create vector operation tests
   - Document vector operation patterns

2. SLERP Merging Implementation
   - Implement actual SLERP algorithm
   - Add interpolation controls
   - Create merging tests
   - Document merging strategies

3. Production Testing
   - Test parallel processing with real workloads
   - Verify feature flag behavior
   - Monitor system performance
   - Document production patterns

4. Performance Optimization
   - Optimize vector operations
   - Enhance parallel processing
   - Improve response merging
   - Update performance docs

## Testing Focus
- Vector operation accuracy
- SLERP merging quality
- Parallel processing efficiency
- Feature flag reliability

## Environment Setup
1. Activate Python virtual environment:
```powershell
& C:\dev\venvs\multi-llm-wrapper\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install/verify dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Key Learnings
1. Placeholder implementations help validate architecture
2. Feature flags crucial for safe rollout
3. Comprehensive testing essential for complex operations
4. Documentation must stay synchronized with implementation

## Additional Notes
- Consider caching for vector operations
- Monitor SLERP performance impact
- Track parallel processing resource usage
- Document all feature flag states
