# Development Session Continuation - January 22, 2025 17:50

## Current Status

### Project Context
- BraveSearchAggregator is transitioning to replace current BraveSearchIntegration
- Moving from simple web search to full knowledge aggregation
- Part of improving multi-llm-wrapper's search capabilities
- Supports both web interface integration and standalone component use

### Recent Changes
- Implemented provider-specific HTTP response mocking
- Added comprehensive provider response format testing
- Fixed configuration and model map handling
- Improved test suite organization

### Completed Tasks
1. HTTP Mocking Infrastructure
   - Added provider-specific response formats
   - Implemented URL-based response selection
   - Improved error handling at SDK and HTTP levels
   - Added support for both web interface and standalone component testing

2. Test Framework Enhancement
   - Added provider-specific format validation
   - Updated provider selection tests
   - Added cross-provider compatibility testing
   - Separated web interface and aggregator component tests

3. Configuration Improvements
   - Fixed TestConfig reference
   - Added proper model map handling
   - Improved provider selection logic
   - Added configuration support for both integration modes

### Current Issues
1. Need to support both web interface and standalone modes
2. Transition plan needs test coverage
3. Knowledge aggregation features need implementation
4. Integration testing between components needed

## Next Development Session Tasks

1. Component Separation
   - Separate web interface and standalone component tests
   - Add integration tests between components
   - Implement clean separation of concerns
   - Document component interactions

2. Knowledge Aggregation Enhancement
   - Implement advanced query analysis
   - Add content synthesis capabilities
   - Support multiple search strategies
   - Add reference tracking

3. Transition Support
   - Create migration tests
   - Add compatibility layer
   - Document transition process
   - Implement feature flags

4. Documentation Updates
   - Update architecture documentation
   - Add transition guide
   - Document new test structure
   - Add component interaction diagrams

## Required Changes

### Component Separation Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_component_interaction():
    """Test web interface interaction with aggregator"""
    web_interface = BraveSearchIntegration()
    aggregator = BraveSearchAggregator()
    
    # Test search flow
    query = "test query"
    web_results = await web_interface.search(query)
    aggregated_results = await aggregator.process_results(web_results)
    
    assert aggregated_results.enhanced
    assert aggregated_results.references
```

### Knowledge Aggregation Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_knowledge_synthesis():
    """Test advanced knowledge synthesis"""
    aggregator = BraveSearchAggregator()
    
    results = await aggregator.synthesize_knowledge(
        query="test query",
        strategy="comprehensive",
        include_references=True
    )
    
    assert results.synthesis
    assert results.confidence_scores
    assert results.source_verification
```

## Testing Focus
- Component interaction
- Knowledge synthesis
- Transition compatibility
- Integration scenarios

## Environment Setup
1. Activate Python virtual environment:
```powershell
& C:\dev\venvs\multi-llm-wrapper\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install/verify dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Key Learnings
1. Component separation requires careful interface design
2. Transition requires maintaining compatibility
3. Knowledge aggregation needs flexible architecture
4. Test isolation critical for component testing

## Additional Notes
- Consider phased transition approach
- Monitor performance impact of enhanced features
- Plan for backward compatibility
- Consider A/B testing during transition
