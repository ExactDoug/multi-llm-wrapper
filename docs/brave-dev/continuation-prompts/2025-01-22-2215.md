# Development Session Continuation - January 22, 2025 22:15

## Progress Update

### Completed Tasks
1. QueryAnalyzer Implementation
   - Successfully tested with comprehensive test coverage
   - Maintains advanced features while supporting MVP requirements
   - Specialized for search engine-based knowledge sources only
   - All tests passing with 83% code coverage

2. KnowledgeAggregator Implementation
   - Basic result processing working
   - Source attribution implemented
   - Grid-compatible formatting ready
   - Parallel processing verified

### Current Status
- QueryAnalyzer and KnowledgeAggregator components are ready
- Test infrastructure operational (port 8001)
- Knowledge graph updated with component relationships
- Documentation structure reorganized

## Next Phase: Integration

### 1. LLMService Integration
- Update service.py to use new components
- Maintain separation between:
  * Regular LLM interactions (direct through LLMService)
  * Search engine knowledge sources (using QueryAnalyzer)

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create BraveKnowledgeAggregator Integration:
```python
# Example integration flow
if model == "brave_search":
    # 1. Analyze query
    analysis = await query_analyzer.analyze_query(query)
    search_query = analysis.search_string
    
    # 2. Execute search
    results = await self.wrapper.brave_search.search(search_query)
    
    # 3. Aggregate results
    aggregated = await knowledge_aggregator.process_results(results)
    
    # 4. Format and return
    yield formatted_response(aggregated)
```

2. Required Updates:
   - [ ] Create BraveKnowledgeAggregator class
   - [ ] Add integration in LLMService
   - [ ] Update grid display handling
   - [ ] Add error handling
   - [ ] Update tests

### 2. Testing Requirements
1. Component Testing
   - Integration with LLMService
   - Grid display compatibility
   - Error scenarios
   - Performance validation

2. End-to-End Testing
   - Complete workflow verification
   - Grid display rendering
   - Error handling
   - Response formatting

### 3. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update implementation docs
- [ ] Add integration guide
- [ ] Document testing procedures
- [ ] Update configuration guide

## Architecture Notes
- QueryAnalyzer is specialized for search engine-based knowledge sources
- Regular LLM interactions bypass QueryAnalyzer
- Future search engine knowledge sources will follow same pattern
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps
1. Begin LLMService integration
2. Implement BraveKnowledgeAggregator class
3. Update grid display handling
4. Add comprehensive tests

## Security Considerations
- Maintain API key security
- Validate all inputs
- Monitor rate limiting
- Handle errors appropriately
