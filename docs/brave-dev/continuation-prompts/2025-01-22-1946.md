# Development Session Continuation - January 22, 2025 19:46

## Current Status

### Project Context
- multi-llm-wrapper is the main project with integrated components:
  1. Web Interface (Multi-LLM Grid)
     - Basic 5x2 grid layout ✓
     - Simple result display ✓
     - Basic error handling ✓
  2. Core Features (MVP)
     - Basic query processing ✓
     - Simple parallel processing ✓
     - Basic result combination ✓
  3. Advanced Features (Implemented but Need Testing)
     - Initial MoE routing framework
     - Basic task vector operations (placeholder)
     - Simple SLERP-based merging (placeholder)

### Recent Changes
- Refocused project on MVP stability and real-world testing
- Updated documentation to reflect MVP-first approach
- Separated MVP and advanced feature configurations
- Added feature flags for controlled testing
- Updated component interaction documentation

### Current State
1. Working MVP Features
   - Basic query processing and validation
   - Simple parallel processing framework
   - Basic grid integration
   - Error handling and logging
   - Feature flag system

2. Features Needing Real-World Testing
   - Parallel processing efficiency
   - Response synthesis quality
   - Grid display integration
   - Error handling robustness
   - Feature flag behavior

3. Advanced Features (On Hold)
   - MoE routing framework
   - Task vector operations
   - SLERP-based merging
   - Multiple synthesis modes

## Next Development Session Tasks

### 1. Real-World Testing (Immediate Priority)
- Test with actual Brave Search API
  * Verify query processing
  * Test rate limiting
  * Validate error handling
  * Document actual capabilities

- Test parallel processing
  * Verify with real workloads
  * Monitor resource usage
  * Test error recovery
  * Document performance

- Test grid integration
  * Verify display functionality
  * Test user interactions
  * Validate error states
  * Check responsiveness

### 2. MVP Stabilization
- Address testing issues
  * Fix any bugs found
  * Optimize performance
  * Improve error handling
  * Update logging

- Complete basic features
  * Finalize grid integration
  * Complete error handling
  * Add basic metrics
  * Update documentation

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Document actual capabilities
- Update configuration guides
- Create troubleshooting guide
- Update testing documentation

## Testing Focus
- Real-world API interaction
- Parallel processing efficiency
- Grid display functionality
- Error handling scenarios
- Feature flag behavior

## Environment Setup
1. Activate Python virtual environment:
```powershell
& C:\dev\venvs\multi-llm-wrapper\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install/verify dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Key Learnings
1. Real-world testing is essential before expanding features
2. Feature flags enable controlled testing and rollback
3. Documentation must reflect actual capabilities
4. MVP stability takes priority over advanced features

## Additional Notes
- Focus on completing MVP before expanding advanced features
- Document actual performance characteristics
- Keep feature flags for controlled testing
- Maintain fallback mechanisms

## Post-MVP Roadmap
Only after MVP is stable and well-tested:
1. Complete task vector operations
2. Enhance SLERP-based merging
3. Expand synthesis capabilities
4. Add advanced metrics
