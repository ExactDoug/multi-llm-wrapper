# Brave Search Knowledge Aggregator Development Session - January 22, 2025

## Current State
- Initial project structure created
- Architecture documentation completed
- Implementation guide created
- Configuration guide established
- Knowledge graph updated with component relationships

## Next Development Session Tasks

### 1. Core Package Implementation
- [ ] Create Python package structure
- [ ] Implement base classes for each component
- [ ] Set up configuration management
- [ ] Implement error handling

### 2. Query Analyzer Implementation
- [ ] Implement query analysis logic
- [ ] Create search strategy determination
- [ ] Add query optimization
- [ ] Write unit tests

### 3. Content Fetcher Implementation
- [ ] Set up Brave Search client
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add content fetching logic
- [ ] Write unit tests

### 4. Knowledge Synthesizer Implementation
- [ ] Create content processing logic
- [ ] Implement synthesis algorithms
- [ ] Add reference management
- [ ] Write unit tests

### 5. Integration Testing
- [ ] Set up test environment
- [ ] Create integration test suite
- [ ] Implement mock responses
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Using Python 3.11 for development
2. Azure App Service for deployment
3. Azure AD for authentication
4. Application Insights for monitoring

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement caching at this stage?
2. What metrics should we track for synthesis quality?
3. How should we handle failed content fetches?

## Next Steps
1. Begin with core package implementation
2. Focus on Query Analyzer component first
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Implement basic monitoring

- [Implementation Guide](../knowledge-aggregator/implementation.md)
- [Configuration Guide](../knowledge-aggregator/configuration.md)

## Notes for Next Session
- Start with creating the base package structure
- Implement one component at a time
- Focus on core functionality first
- Keep KISS principle in mind
- Ensure proper error handling from the start
