# Development Session Continuation - January 22, 2025 17:54

## Current Status

### Project Context
- multi-llm-wrapper is the main project with two key components:
  1. Web Interface (Multi-LLM Grid)
     - 5x2 grid layout supporting 10 knowledge sources
     - Streaming responses with real-time updates
     - Response synthesis across all sources
  2. Standalone Components
     - BraveSearchAggregator replacing BraveSearchIntegration
     - Enhanced search and synthesis capabilities
     - Azure deployment target

### Recent Changes
- Implemented provider-specific HTTP response mocking
- Added comprehensive provider response format testing
- Fixed configuration and model map handling
- Improved test suite organization

### Completed Tasks
1. HTTP Mocking Infrastructure
   - Added provider-specific response formats
   - Implemented URL-based response selection
   - Improved error handling at SDK and HTTP levels
   - Added support for both web interface and standalone testing

2. Test Framework Enhancement
   - Added provider-specific format validation
   - Updated provider selection tests
   - Added cross-provider compatibility testing
   - Separated web interface and aggregator component tests

3. Configuration Improvements
   - Fixed TestConfig reference
   - Added proper model map handling
   - Improved provider selection logic
   - Added configuration support for both integration modes

### Current Issues
1. Need to maintain grid functionality during transition
2. Synthesis system needs enhancement for aggregator
3. Integration testing between components needed
4. Web interface updates required for new capabilities

## Next Development Session Tasks

1. Grid Integration
   - Update web interface for enhanced capabilities
   - Maintain streaming response support
   - Ensure synthesis across all sources
   - Preserve responsive layout

2. Knowledge Aggregation Enhancement
   - Implement advanced query analysis
   - Add content synthesis capabilities
   - Support multiple search strategies
   - Add reference tracking

3. Component Integration
   - Create integration tests
   - Add compatibility layer
   - Document component interactions
   - Implement feature flags

4. Documentation Updates
   - Update architecture documentation
   - Add transition guide
   - Document grid layout changes
   - Add component interaction diagrams

## Required Changes

### Grid Integration Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_grid_integration():
    """Test grid interface with new aggregator"""
    grid = MultiLLMGrid()
    aggregator = BraveSearchAggregator()
    
    # Test search and synthesis
    query = "test query"
    results = await grid.process_query(
        query,
        knowledge_sources=["brave_search"]
    )
    
    assert results.sources["brave_search"].enhanced
    assert results.synthesis.includes_references
```

### Knowledge Aggregation Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_knowledge_synthesis():
    """Test advanced knowledge synthesis"""
    aggregator = BraveSearchAggregator()
    
    results = await aggregator.synthesize_knowledge(
        query="test query",
        strategy="comprehensive",
        include_references=True
    )
    
    assert results.synthesis
    assert results.confidence_scores
    assert results.source_verification
```

## Testing Focus
- Grid functionality preservation
- Knowledge synthesis enhancement
- Component integration
- Streaming response support

## Environment Setup
1. Activate Python virtual environment:
```powershell
& C:\dev\venvs\multi-llm-wrapper\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install/verify dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Key Learnings
1. Grid integration requires careful UI updates
2. Component separation needs clear interfaces
3. Synthesis system must scale with capabilities
4. Test isolation critical for all components

## Additional Notes
- Consider phased grid updates
- Monitor streaming performance
- Plan for backward compatibility
- Consider A/B testing during transition
- Maintain responsive layout during changes
