## Architectural Decision: BraveKnowledgeAggregator Model Interface Pattern

### Context
During integration of BraveKnowledgeAggregator into the multi-llm grid, we identified an opportunity to enhance its architecture while maintaining its rich capabilities.

### Decision
Implement a dual interface approach where BraveKnowledgeAggregator:
1. Maintains its rich internal format and capabilities
2. Presents as a standard model through the wrapper interface
3. Handles format transformation at the wrapper layer

### Benefits
- Seamless integration with multi-llm grid
- Preservation of enhanced capabilities
- Future flexibility for independent use
- Pattern reusability for other non-LLM components

### Implementation Plan
1. Keep BraveKnowledgeAggregator's internal rich format:
   - Query analysis
   - Search result formatting
   - Knowledge synthesis
   - Enhanced error details

2. Add format transformation in wrapper layer:
   - Transform rich responses to standard model format
   - Standardize error handling
   - Maintain streaming compatibility

3. Testing Requirements:
   - Verify format transformation
   - Test streaming behavior
   - Validate error handling
   - Check synthesis integration

## Next Development Session Tasks

1. Implementation
   - Update service.py to handle format transformation
   - Test BraveKnowledgeAggregator in multi-llm grid
   - Verify streaming and synthesis integration

2. Documentation Updates
   - Add model interface pattern to architecture docs
   - Update component interaction diagrams
   - Enhance implementation guide
   - Preserve all existing documentation

3. Testing
   - Run streaming verification tests
   - Validate synthesis integration
   - Test error handling scenarios
   - Monitor performance metrics

## Notes
- This architectural pattern sets a precedent for integrating other sophisticated components as models
- All existing documentation should be preserved and enhanced, not replaced
- Knowledge graph updated to reflect this architectural pattern
