- [ ] Implement ContentFetcher
  * Set up Brave Search client
  * Add rate limiting
  * Implement content fetching
  * Add error handling

- [ ] Implement KnowledgeSynthesizer
  * Create synthesis logic
  * Add reference management
  * Implement content processing
  * Add unit tests

### 3. Integration Development
- [ ] Create component integration tests
- [ ] Implement end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring

### 4. Azure Integration
- [ ] Set up Azure resources
- [ ] Configure authentication
- [ ] Implement monitoring
- [ ] Add deployment scripts

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Using Python 3.11
2. Virtual environment at C:\dev\venvs\multi-llm-wrapper
3. PowerShell as primary shell
4. Async-first implementation
5. Modular architecture
6. Test-driven development approach
7. Azure App Service deployment

## Development Environment Setup
1. Virtual Environment:
   ```powershell
   # Activate virtual environment
   & C:\dev\venvs\multi-llm-wrapper\Scripts\Activate.ps1

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Testing:
   ```powershell
   # Run specific tests
   python -m pytest tests/brave_search_aggregator/test_query_analyzer.py -v

   # Run all tests
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```

## Open Questions
1. Caching strategy for search results
2. Metrics for synthesis quality
3. Error handling for failed fetches
4. Load balancing requirements

## Resources
- [Architecture Documentation](../knowledge-aggregator/architecture.md)
- [Implementation Guide](../knowledge-aggregator/implementation.md)
- [Configuration Guide](../knowledge-aggregator/configuration.md)

## Next Steps
1. Complete QueryAnalyzer testing
2. Begin ContentFetcher implementation
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Create development environment guide

## Notes
- Keep KISS principle in mind
- Focus on core functionality first
- Maintain test coverage
- Document as we go
- Consider reusability in other projects
- Use PowerShell commands for Windows environment
