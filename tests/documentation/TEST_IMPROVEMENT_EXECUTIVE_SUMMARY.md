## Implementation Approach: Orchestrated Automation

### Advanced Orchestration Strategy
Building on our successful RAG research orchestration, we recommend implementing the test improvement process using **AI-powered subprocess orchestration**:

#### 11-Step Automated Process (Per Test)
1. **Execute existing test** and capture results
2. **Document pass/fail status** with detailed output
3. **Compare against RAG analysis** for alignment assessment
4. **Determine improvement needs** (test, code, or both)
5. **Explain rationale** for recommended changes
6. **Analyze test changes** (complexity, risk assessment)
7. **Analyze code changes** (complexity, risk assessment)  
8. **Assess cross-test impact** of code changes
9. **Generate comprehensive analysis** document
10. **Create implementation plan** with risk mitigation
11. **Document findings** in standardized format

#### Orchestration Benefits
- **Consistency**: Standardized analysis across all tests
- **Efficiency**: Parallel processing of test analysis
- **Transparency**: Real-time progress tracking
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and restart capability
- **Quality**: Systematic documentation and validation
