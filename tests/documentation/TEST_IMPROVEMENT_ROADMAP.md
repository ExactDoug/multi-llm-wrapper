# Test Improvement Implementation Roadmap

**Project**: Multi-LLM Wrapper Test Suite Modernization  
**Based on**: Comprehensive RAG Research Analysis (38 test files)  
**Orchestration Method**: AI-Powered Subprocess Automation  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  

---

## Roadmap Overview

This roadmap provides a systematic, phased approach to implementing the recommendations from our comprehensive RAG research analysis. The implementation leverages AI-powered orchestration to ensure consistent, efficient, and transparent execution across all 38 test files.

### Orchestration Philosophy

Building on the successful RAG research orchestration, all improvements will be implemented using the **11-Step Automated Analysis Process**:

1. **Execute existing test** → Document current state  
2. **Analyze test results** → Pass/fail with detailed diagnostics  
3. **Compare with RAG research** → Alignment assessment  
4. **Determine improvement scope** → Test, code, or both  
5. **Document rationale** → Why changes are needed  
6. **Plan test modifications** → Complexity & risk analysis  
7. **Plan code modifications** → Complexity & risk analysis  
8. **Assess cross-test impact** → Identify dependency chains  
9. **Generate implementation plan** → Step-by-step execution  
10. **Create risk mitigation strategy** → Handle potential issues  
11. **Document comprehensive analysis** → Standardized reporting
