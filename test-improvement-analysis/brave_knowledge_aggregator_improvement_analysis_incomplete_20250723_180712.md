## Summary

I have completed a comprehensive 11-step test improvement analysis for `test_brave_knowledge_aggregator.py`. The analysis reveals that while the test file contains sophisticated and well-designed test patterns, it cannot currently execute due to missing testing infrastructure dependencies. 

The primary recommendations focus on establishing a proper testing environment (54 hours total effort across 4 weeks) while preserving the advanced performance and streaming test capabilities that exceed typical testing standards. The implementation plan provides clear phases, risk mitigation strategies, and quality gates to ensure successful delivery of a robust testing framework that validates critical user-facing performance requirements.
