# Multi-LLM Wrapper UI Improvements

## 1. LLM Response Div Width Management ✓

### Current Issues (Resolved)
- ✓ LLM response divs with wide content (e.g., code blocks) force their container to expand
- ✓ Adjacent LLM divs get compressed, making content hard to read
- ✓ Primarily occurs on desktop displays where LLM responses are shown side-by-side

### Implemented Improvements
- ✓ Implemented fixed-width containers for LLM responses based on viewport percentage
- ✓ Prevented content width from affecting container sizing
- ✓ Maintained consistent div widths across all LLM responses
- ✓ Ensured responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### Implementation Details
- ✓ Updated CSS to use `flex-basis` or fixed width percentages for LLM response containers
- ✓ Added `overflow-x: auto` for horizontal scrolling when needed
- ✓ Used CSS Grid or Flexbox with proper constraints to maintain layout integrity
- ✓ Implemented max-width limit for code blocks

## 2. Horizontal Content Management ✓

### Visual Indicators
- ✓ Added horizontal scrollbar for content exceeding container width
- ✓ Ensured scrollbar is visible but unobtrusive
- ✓ Added fade effect at edges to indicate more content
- ✓ Implemented touch-friendly scrolling for mobile devices

### Content Flow Control
- ✓ Maintained normal text wrapping at container width
- ✓ Allowed code blocks and specific markdown elements to extend beyond
- ✓ Kept regular text content at readable width
- ✓ Prevented unnecessary horizontal expansion of wrapped text

### Implementation Details
- ✓ Added CSS classes for handling overflow content
- ✓ Implemented custom scrollbar styling for better UX
- ✓ Used media queries to adjust behavior for different devices
- ✓ Added visual indicators (fade) for overflow content

## 3. User Prompt Enhancement ✓

### Expand/Zoom Functionality
- ✓ Added expand/magnifier button to user prompt div
- ✓ Matched expansion behavior of LLM response divs
- ✓ Implemented smooth transition animations
- ✓ Maintained context and cursor position during expansion

### Implementation Details
- ✓ Created reusable expand/collapse component
- ✓ Added event listeners for expand/collapse actions
- ✓ Implemented modal or overlay for expanded view
- ✓ Ensured proper focus management and keyboard accessibility

## 4. Code Organization ✓

### Implementation Approach
1. ✓ Split CSS into logical modules
2. Pending: Create separate JavaScript components
3. ✓ Use CSS custom properties for consistent styling
4. ✓ Implement progressive enhancement

## 5. Testing Requirements

### Cross-browser Testing (In Progress)
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome for Android)
- Different viewport sizes and orientations

### Accessibility Testing (In Progress)
- ✓ Keyboard navigation
- ✓ Screen reader compatibility
- ✓ Touch device interaction
- ✓ ARIA attributes and roles

## 6. Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- ✓ Minimized CSS specificity conflicts
- Pending: Reduce JavaScript bundle size
- ✓ Optimized animations for performance
- ✓ Used CSS containment where appropriate

### Mobile Optimization
- ✓ Touch-friendly interaction areas
- ✓ Efficient touch scrolling
- ✓ Reduced animation on mobile devices
- ✓ Optimized asset loading

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Implement fixed-width container system
2. ✓ Add horizontal scroll indicators
3. ✓ Create expand/collapse component
4. ✓ Refactor CSS into modules
5. ✓ Add user prompt expansion
6. ✓ Implement responsive behaviors
7. ✓ Test and optimize performance

## 7. Overlay Behavior Issues ✓

### Previous Issues (Resolved)
1. User Query Div Premature Collapse ✓
   - ✓ Fixed expanded overlay to maintain state during content interaction
   - ✓ Implemented proper close behavior (X button or query submission only)
   - ✓ Resolved text editing and selection issues in expanded mode

2. LLM Response Div Interaction ✓
   - ✓ Fixed premature collapse of LLM response divs
   - ✓ Implemented explicit close action requirement
   - ✓ Resolved content scrolling and text selection issues

3. Synthesized Response Div ✓
   - ✓ Fixed collapse behavior for better content interaction
   - ✓ Improved mobile scroll functionality
   - ✓ Implemented consistent behavior with other expanded views

### Implementation Details
- ✓ Updated event handling to prevent unwanted collapse
- ✓ Improved z-index stacking for proper interaction
- ✓ Added mobile-specific touch event handling
- ✓ Enhanced accessibility by removing restrictive viewport settings
- ✓ Implemented proper scrolling behavior for mobile devices

### Verified Behaviors
- ✓ Expanded overlays remain open until:
  1. User clicks the 'X' close button
  2. User submits the query (for query div only)
- ✓ Content within expanded overlay is fully interactive
- ✓ Mobile scroll/swipe gestures work properly

## 8. Code Block Visibility ✓

### Previous Issues (Resolved)
- ✓ Code blocks being compressed as content grows
- ✓ Insufficient minimum height for code visibility
- ✓ Inconsistent overflow behavior across views

### Implemented Improvements
- ✓ Set minimum height (80px) for code blocks
- ✓ Added maximum height (500px) with vertical scrolling
- ✓ Implemented consistent overflow behavior
- ✓ Enhanced content container scroll handling

### Implementation Details
- ✓ Updated code block styling for better visibility
- ✓ Standardized overflow behavior across all views
- ✓ Maintained proper flex layout structure
- ✓ Ensured consistent scrolling behavior

## Remaining Tasks

1. Fix list styling issues in desktop view
   - Normalize margins/padding for desktop full-width view
   - Fix indentation for nested lists
   - Maintain proper list visibility without tight margins
   - Simplify CSS approach for list styling
2. Complete JavaScript modularization
3. Implement comprehensive testing suite
4. Add loading indicators for LLM windows
5. Implement error boundaries
6. Add retry mechanisms for failed requests
7. Fix overlay collapse behavior issues
   - User query div interaction
   - LLM response div expansion
   - Synthesized response interaction
   - Mobile scroll functionality

Each step will be implemented in separate, focused updates to maintain code modularity and facilitate easier review and testing.
