# Brave Search Knowledge Aggregator Project Prompt Template

## Project Overview
This project involves the development and implementation of the Brave Search Knowledge Aggregator. The primary goal is to create a streaming-first architecture that integrates with the Brave Search API, focusing on performance, memory management, and error recovery.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Current State Documents
Located in @/docs/brave-dev/current-state/
- project-state-overview.md: Current high-level status
- project-state-technical.md: Current technical details
- project-state-integration.md: Current integration state
- project-state-development.md: Current development status

### 2. Recent History
Located in @/docs/brave-dev/recent-history/
- Maintains the last 3 versions of state documents
- Used for immediate context and comparison
- Updated with each state change
- Includes timestamps in filenames

### 3. Archived State Documents
Located in @/docs/brave-dev/archive/[YYYY]/[MMM]/[DD]/[timestamp]/
Example: @/docs/brave-dev/archive/2025/Feb/20/0102/
- Nested folder structure by date and time
- Small, focused files for faster access
- Complete historical record
- Each timestamp folder contains:
  * project-state-overview.md
  * project-state-technical.md
  * project-state-integration.md
  * project-state-development.md

### 4. State Document Guidelines
1. Current State:
   - Always update current-state/ documents
   - Keep only latest version here
   - All files must be complete and self-contained

2. Recent History:
   - Move previous current state here
   - Keep max 3 recent versions
   - Oldest version moves to archive

3. Archive:
   - Create date-based folder structure
   - Use 24-hour timestamp format
   - Never modify archived files
   - Preserve all historical states

4. File Management:
   - Update current state in-place
   - Archive old versions before updates
   - Maintain consistent naming
   - Include timestamps in archived files

### 5. Other Documentation

- progress-updates.md: Continuous progress log

## Critical Requirements
1. **Performance Targets**:
   - First Status: < 100ms
   - First Result: < 1s
   - Source Selection: < 3s
   - Memory Usage: < 10MB per request
   - Error Rate: < 1%

2. **Resource Constraints**:
   - API Rate Limit: 20 requests/second
   - Connection Timeout: 30 seconds
   - Max Results Per Query: 20

## Development Focus Areas
1. **Async Iterator Pattern**:
   - Fix initialization pattern
   - Implement proper cleanup
   - Verify resource management
   - Test error propagation

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Finalize buffer controls
   - Implement cleanup triggers
   - Verify leak prevention
   - Test resource tracking

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Complete partial results handling
   - Implement state recovery
   - Test error propagation
   - Verify cleanup on failure

4. **Performance Validation**:
   - Response timing
   - Memory usage
   - Throughput testing
   - Resource monitoring

## Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Server**: Running on port 8001 with feature flags enabled for streaming, memory tracking, and error injection.
- **Performance Testing Framework**: Includes load testing and error injection capabilities.
- **Test Scenarios**: Covers streaming behavior, memory management, and error handling.

## Progress Tracking
- **Action Plan**: Updated as tasks are completed.
- **Progress Log**: Maintained in the action plan document.
- **Commit Messages**: Reference the action plan and relevant documentation.
