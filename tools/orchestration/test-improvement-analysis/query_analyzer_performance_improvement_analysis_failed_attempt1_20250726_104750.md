The comprehensive 11-step test improvement analysis for `test_query_analyzer_performance.py` is now complete. The analysis reveals a sophisticated test design hampered by execution barriers and statistical limitations, with a clear roadmap for enhancement requiring 32-40 hours of development effort over 4-5 weeks. The implementation plan provides structured phases from basic execution capability through statistical rigor to comprehensive performance optimization, with specific risk mitigation strategies and quality gates for successful completion.
