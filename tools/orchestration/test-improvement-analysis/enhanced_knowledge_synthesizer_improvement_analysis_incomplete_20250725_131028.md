## Analysis Complete

I have successfully completed the comprehensive 11-step test improvement analysis for `test_enhanced_knowledge_synthesizer.py`. The analysis reveals a well-structured test foundation that requires modernization with RAG-specific evaluation frameworks and enhanced validation capabilities.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Current tests are solid but lack modern RAG evaluation standards
- Primary focus should be on test enhancements (70 hours) rather than major code rewrites
- Implementation should be phased over 4 weeks with careful risk management
- Success depends on proper framework integration and maintaining backward compatibility

The analysis provides actionable recommendations with specific code examples, effort estimates, and risk mitigation strategies to guide the implementation of these improvements.
