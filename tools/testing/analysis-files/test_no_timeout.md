The `content_fetcher` is a sophisticated asynchronous web content fetching and processing system within the Brave Search Knowledge Aggregator. It provides:

**Core Functionality:**
- Fetches web content from URLs with support for HTML, JSON, XML, and plain text
- Extracts meaningful content (removes scripts, hidden elements from HTML)
- Implements intelligent rate limiting and caching mechanisms
- Handles concurrent requests with semaphore-based throttling
- Provides streaming interfaces for real-time result processing

**Key Features:**
- **Rate Limiting**: Global and per-domain request throttling
- **Caching**: TTL-based content caching with size management  
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling for timeouts, client errors, and content issues
- **Content Processing**: Intelligent extraction based on content type detection
- **Concurrency**: Async/await patterns with semaphore control for parallel fetching

The component serves as the foundation for retrieving and preprocessing web content in the knowledge aggregation pipeline at `src/brave_search_aggregator/fetcher/content_fetcher.py:560`.
